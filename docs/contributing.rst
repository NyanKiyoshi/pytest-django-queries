Recommendations
+++++++++++++++

- Try to be on one of the latest master versions.
- Try to always put and commit your change sets into a new and meaningful branch in your fork.
- Update the changelog file with the changes you made.


Code Style
++++++++++

We are using `Black <https://github.com/python/black>`_ and `Flake 8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ to ensure a consistent code-style and reduce common Python issues in changes.

You can install a checker by running ``pre-commit install`` after installing our development requirements (``pip install -e '.[dev]'``). After that, you can add your changes through ``git`` and run ``pre-commit`` to check if your changes are issue-free.
